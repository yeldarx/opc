### Curriculum  

The course structure is not yet finalized, but it will be developed right here. Our vision is to create a comprehensive guide that takes you through every stage of podcasting, step by step.  

And the best part? **You can be part of its creation!**  

Join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/yeldarx/opc) to contribute your ideas, suggest topics, and help shape the future of this curriculum. Together, weâ€™ll build an invaluable resource for podcasters at every level!
